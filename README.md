# Eye Project

## Decription
In this project of MITxPro, I made an animation of eyes that follow your mouse. This was posible by manipulating the DOM with JavaScript and listen mouse moving event to catch the position of the mouse and move elements in the DOM to make the animation of eyes that follow your mouse. Here you will find not only an html file and a css file, but also a javascript file where in a few lines I could made this animation possible.

## How to run:

Clone this repo in your local environment usin

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EffrenAnthony/pacmen
```

Go to the root of your project and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Intrucctions:

- Create pacmens with the create button
- Create as many as you want
- Start the game with "Start game" button
- Continue clicking to make the game faster

## Roadmap of future improvements:

Some of the next functionalities that I would like to implement in this project are:

- Stop the game
- Restart from scratch
- Restart from last Stop
- Change assets to create randomly between pacman and ghosts
